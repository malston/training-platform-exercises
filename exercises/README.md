# Exercises

Hands-on exercises for each module of the [Platform Engineer Learning Path](https://malston.github.io/claude-code-wiki/training/platform-engineer-path/).

| Module             | Directory            | Focus                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Architecture    | `01-architecture/`   | Request flow, control points, config hierarchy   |
| 2. Infrastructure  | `02-infrastructure/` | VPC endpoints, inference profiles, gateway setup |
| 3. Configuration   | `03-configuration/`  | Managed settings, CLAUDE.md hierarchy            |
| 4. Permissions     | `04-permissions/`    | Permission rules, sandboxing, cascade testing    |
| 5. Cost Management | `05-cost/`           | Budget controls, dashboards, rate limiting       |
| 6. Rollout         | `06-rollout/`        | Cohort planning, rollback, success metrics       |

Each directory has a `README.md` with exercise instructions. Work through them in module order -- later modules build on earlier ones.
